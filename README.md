## Summary: 
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

Based on the analysis performed there does not seem to be any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program.  The higher review ration within the vine program was actually lower at 42% and the unpaid reviews with those reviewers giving a 5 or greater rating 50% of the time.

To evaluate the successfulness of the program I would look at two different statistics.
* Do paid Vine users give more reviews that unpaid shoppers?  In particular do they give more viable or helpful reviews that their counterparts.
* Also what is the percentage of paid Vine reviews who actually made a verified purchase.  To really review a product hands on testing is the real key ingredients in the value of the review.  This analysis might be performed by filtering on Vine "Y" reviews & verified purchse and comparing that dataset with the Vine "N" reviews & verified purchase.
